I have uploaded a PNG of the ER Model Design and the Relational Database Schema to the repository and it is in the project report pdf.

You will need: Java JDK 11 or newer PostgreSQL PostgreSQL JDBC driver

Database setup: Open pgAdmin. Create a database named HealthAndFitnessClubManagementSystem (right click on Databases -> create -> Database then Enter HealthAndFitnessClubManagementSystem in the Database section. Open a SQL Query tool and run the ddl.sql file and then run the dml.sql file, these files can be found in the directory titled "SQL".

Setting up JAVA CRUD code using JDBC:
Download PostgreSQL JDBC driver
You will want to create a new project and create a java file in that project in src called finalProject.
Add the .jar file to you project as an external library (if you are using intelliJ press 'F4' go to the libraries section and click the '+' sign and select 'Java' and now navigate to where you downloaded the .jar file and select it and click 'ok'.

You can find the java code in the repository and you want to paste that into your file. Replace the username and password with your PostgreSQL username and password (the default username is postgres). Run the java program and it should work.
